# Sandbox to solve sudoku 

Source code for backtracking solving sudoku

Got the task to write an sudoku solver at a job interview.

First got stuck, so took it home, and collected informations, read tutorials, to learn how
such a problem could be solved.

After understanding the basics, wrote the application and added Unit tests.
